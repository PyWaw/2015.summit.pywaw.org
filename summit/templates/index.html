            <p>Everybody's always talking about Big Data, and aspiring to be the company that can expend whole datacentres just to handle their latest feature, but that has a massive engineering and ops cost - and as a small-to-medium company, that's probably not what you need.</p>
            <p>Learn about data storage patterns that are designed for the rest of us - how you can design data storage not just for scalability but also for rapid development, continuous deployment, and lower hardware requirements. Plus, a look at how to approach some more extreme storage challenges.</p>

            <h3 class="speaker-modal__talk-title">Talk: Stories about decentralization and diversity</h3>
            <p>Since my keynote at EP2013 about “the return of P2P computing” i’ve been to many meet ups and discussions to “redecentralize” the web. I’d like to summarize and highlight what i’ve learned about the topic on technical, economic and philosophical levels since my talk in Florence.
               What is technically hard about building distributed systems without a controlling center?  What is attractive and to be liked about centralization, actually?  How is "normative" thinking regarding gender or race related?  Last but not least i’ll focus on what role Python does and could play in existing “redencentralization” projects. </p>

            <h3 class="speaker-modal__talk-title">Talk: Designing Large-Scale Applications in Python</h3>
            <p>Concepts for designing large and scalable Python applications that work in practice. Python is often referred to as a scripting language. While Python is an ideal platform for scripting, integration or plugin tasks, it does in fact cover all the concepts needed for truly large-scale object oriented application development. However, complex applications bring new challenges. The talk draws on my experience with large-scale application design using Python as central implementation language and provides a cookbook approach to many of the problems you face when designing and organizing complex application frameworks. The approach has been used in many real-life projects, ranging from web application servers in varying fields of application to complete finance trading systems. Python has always proven to be a truly good choice with an outstanding time-to-market advantage over other implementation languages such as Java or C++. It allows small software development companies to successfully compete against multi-million dollar ventures.</p>

            <p>asyncio is the reason to switch to Python 3 now. There, I said it. Is this used in production at Facebook? It is. On how many machines? On all of them. Why? It makes concurrent code easier to read. Easier to test. Sometimes even faster to run.</p>
            <p>If the words "event loop", "coroutine", "yield from", "executor" or "future" make you feel uneasy, come learn how beautiful and easy to understand it actually is at the core. No prior asyncore, Twisted or Node.js experience required.</p>

            <h3 class="speaker-modal__talk-title">Talk: Hoist Your I/O</h3>
            <p>Our programs too often leave control decisions stranded in low-level routines, producing tightly coupled systems that make it difficult to re-use code. What are the warning signs of tightly coupled I/O and how can it be corrected? Particular attention will be paid to the way that modern Python syntax supports a broader array of solutions than were once possible!</p>

            <p>Honza is a Python programmer and Django core developer – since he is scared of the bright and shiny world of browsers, designers, and users he prefers to stay buried deep in the infrastructure code and just provides others with tools to do the actual site-building.</p>
            <p>Since 2008 Honza has been building content web sites for fun and profit. During this time he discovered Elasticsearch which lead to him joining the company behind it in 2013 to work on the Python drivers.</p>
            <h3 class="speaker-modal__talk-title">Talk: Beyond the basics with Elasticsearch</h3>
            <p>Elasticsearch has many use cases, some of them fairly obvious and widely used, like plain searching through documents or analytics. In this talk I would like to go through some of the more advanced scenarios we have seen in the wild. Some examples of what we will cover:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Trend detection - how you can use the aggregation framework to go beyond simple "counting" and make use of the full-text properties of Elasticsearch.</li>
              <li>Percolator - percolator is reversed search and many people use it as such to drive alerts or "stored search" functionality for their website, let's look at how we can use it to detect languages, geo locations or drive live search.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If we end up with some time to spare we can explore some other ideas about how we can utilize the features of a search engine to drive non-trivial data analysis.</p>

            <h3 class="speaker-modal__talk-title">Talk: A Brief Introduction to Practical Robotics in Python</h3>
            <p>Very few of us would write our own web server from scratch using first principals. The python ecosystem has so many tools to make it fast and easy to create a fairly sophisticated web application. But what about if you want to build a robot? It turns out that one of the best robotics packages in the world has python hooks, and you can use it to do all sorts of awesome things. This talk will give a brief introduction to Robot Operating System and how to interface with it in python. In this talk we will cover the basics of ROS setup, package building, and robot software development. In particular we will look at how to interface with different bits of hardware, build up complex robot behaviors from that hardware, and then deploy the results.</p>

Started by two Polish girls in Berlin and now organized all over the world in 45 cities, Django Girls aim to inspire women to fall in love with programming. Ola will share with you how she went from not knowing anything about teaching programming or feminism, to knowing a little bit more thanks to thousands of people who participated in the workshop formula Django Girls created. You'll learn the secrets of explaining the Internet, servers or ORM to people who never done this before. And how to find 100+ women who want to learn to code just about anywhere. This talk is your introduction to the world of getting girls excited about snakes, ponies and balloons.</p>

            <h3 class="speaker-modal__talk-title">Talk: Modern Deployments</h3>
            <p>Deploying your application is a critical part of your getting things done pipeline.</p>
            <p>Still, making your beautiful creation publicly available can become a messy process full of nightmares you -- or your infrastructure team -- wish were never there.</p>
            <p>Instead of fearing it, embrace early and often deployments, assisted by tools that help you develop and scale your apps.</p>
            <p>This talk is a demo of how to deploy Python-based web applications using the open-source PaaS OpenShift, that relies on cool modern technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.</p>

            <h3 class="speaker-modal__talk-title">Talk: Into the Rabbit Hole</h3>
            <p>Django is awesome when it comes to speeding up a development process. The famous Django’s magic will let you develop quickly and easily. But there are times, when Django's magic is gone and you end up in a rabbit hole, chasing a rabbit instead of stoping as soon as possible and find your way out.</p>
            <p>The talk will be a case study of how one can end up in rabbit hole. We will see how easy it is to end up digging in Django Model Forms, instead of looking at the problem objectively.</p>
            <p>The talk goal is to start a discussion about techniques that help you realize that you are going in a wrong direction and you should go back one or two steps as soon as possible.</p>

            <h3 class="speaker-modal__talk-title">Talk: Real-time web apps with (just) Python and Postgres</h3>
            <p>The design and documentation of the leading Python web frameworks are heavily focused on building web sites, with HTML content rendered on the server, and require significant effort to support modern web apps that use RESTful APIs, real-time updates over websockets, and Javascript-based user interfaces.</p>
            <p>If we start with a clean slate and design a framework around the needs of a real-time single-page-application, several things become apparent:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>A big framework like Django has a lot of stuff we don't need, while still missing a lot of stuff we do need.</li>
              <li>Minimalist Python HTTP libraries (Werkzeug, CherryPy) can still do most of the heavy lifting on the server side, and save us from having to start completely from scratch.</li>
              <li>Gevent can allow a Python application to scale to large numbers of simultaneous connections without littering a codebase with hard-to-follow callbacks.</li>
              <li>Without a big framework in the way, an API can cleanly add live websocket streams to existing RESTful endpoints, to deliver exactly the data that clients are interested in.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Using the well-known TodoMVC application as an example, this presentation will give a tour of a simple Python backend that provides live syncing between browsers using just Python, Postgres, and a Werkzeug based micro framework that integrates REST endpoints and websockets into a single, coherent API.</p>
            <p>Though approachable to beginners, this talk will be of greatest interest to intermediate-level Python programmers who have used Django in the past and wondered how to move on to something more modern, but not more complicated.</p>

            <p>I've been using Python profesionally since 2009. I'm a developer and an Open Source contributor for a number of projects. I added some features to Postgres embedded Python bindings, maintain an asynchronous Postgres driver for Twisted called txpostgres and wrote a Twisted connector for Pika (a Python AMQP library). Currently, I work as Lead Developer for New Relic, an Application Performance Monitoring company, after they acquired a startup I founded earlier.</p>
            <h3 class="speaker-modal__talk-title">Talk: On snakes and elephants</h3>
            <p>Everyone knows you can connect to PostgreSQL from Python, but not everyone knows you can actually make the PostgreSQL server process execute Python code in an embedded interpreter.</p>
            <p>PL/Python is a stored procedure language for PostgreSQL, allowing extending Postgres with Python.</p>
            <p>The use cases are limitless, from moving your business logic into the database, to doing number crunching inside the database server process without having to ship raw data to external worker nodes.</p>
            <p>We'll talk about how would you write an embedded Python procedure inside Postgres, what functionality it offers and what are the quirks and challenges posed by running a Python interpreter inside a database server process.</p>

            <p>Microservices architecture is trendy right now ;) It's often a good choice for building sophisticated applications but on the other hand you have to be aware about difficulties with this architecture. What do you need to remember about if you have monolithic app right now and want to move into microservices world? I would like to summarize what I've learned about this transition process recently. This presentation will shortly cover main issues you will have to solve during transition process and how Python can help here:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>infrastructure - how many hosts do you need, is it expensive?</li>
              <li>release and deployment - how to version your applications and run them,</li>
              <li>testing - what do you need to test process which uses many services?</li>
              <li>communication between services - what python tools can be handy?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This talk will be of greatest interest to everybody feeling responsible for architecture of Python systems they are working on.</p>
